# @node-xray/dashboard

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 2f7c27f: Replace the inline placeholder dashboard with the real `@node-xray/dashboard`
  package. The dashboard ships as three static assets (`index.html`,
  `app.js`, `styles.css`) that the adapters discover through the new
  `getAssetsDir()` helper and pass to the core via the new
  `core.mount(server, { assetsDir })` option.

  Highlights:

  - **`@node-xray/dashboard`** is now a real package. It contains a
    faithful port of the v4.1 mockup (top bar with live event-loop
    lag, requests sidebar with filters, runtime tab with call stack /
    Node APIs / event loop / macro+micro queues / async waterfall /
    timeline / async grid, body inspector tab with request+response
    panels, aggregate stat bar, pause / clear / sort controls)
    rendered by a vanilla-JS WebSocket client that consumes the
    `@node-xray/types` wire protocol. No framework, no build step.
  - **`@node-xray/core`** serves the assets synchronously from memory,
    replacing the inline redirect placeholder. The mount API now
    accepts `{ assetsDir }`; when omitted the route returns a 503
    install hint so dashboards still load gracefully.
  - **`@node-xray/express`**, **`@node-xray/fastify`**, and
    **`@node-xray/nestjs`** each declare `@node-xray/dashboard` as a
    runtime dependency and pass `getAssetsDir()` through to the core
    on first request. The inline `DASHBOARD_HTML` placeholders are
    gone; the first request to the dashboard path returns the
    real UI.
  - New tests: 9 dashboard asset / wire-protocol sanity tests and 3
    core mount-with-assetsDir tests cover the new surface.

  **Security**

  - **Redaction deny list expanded.** The default `redactHeaders` now
    covers 24 sensitive headers (was 14): adds `www-authenticate`,
    `proxy-authenticate`, `cookie2`, `x-auth-token`, `x-access-token`,
    `x-refresh-token`, `x-id-token`, `x-session-id`, `x-csrf-token`,
    `x-xsrf-token`. The default `redactBodyPaths` now covers 22 sensitive
    field names (was 10), including `passwd`, `pwd`, `apiKey`/`api_key`,
    `accessToken`/`access_token`, `refreshToken`/`refresh_token`,
    `idToken`/`id_token`, `sessionId`/`session_id`, `authorization`,
    `privateKey`/`private_key`, `cvv`, `pin`, `creditCard`/`credit_card`,
    `ssn`, `phone`. Cards[].pin is also masked.
  - **Opt-out for full fidelity.** `XRayOptions.redactHeaders` and
    `redactBodyPaths` now accept `false` to disable the default deny
    list for users in trusted environments.
  - **Dashboard HTTP endpoint is auth-gated.** Previously only the
    WebSocket upgrade required credentials; the dashboard HTML, JS, and
    CSS were served unauthenticated. They now go through the same
    `authorize()` check as the WS path. Unauthenticated requests get
    `401 Unauthorized` with `WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="node-xray"`.
  - **CSP tightened.** `script-src 'self'` (no `'unsafe-inline'`). Added
    `form-action 'none'`, `base-uri 'none'`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`.
    Added `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy:
same-origin`, `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin`. All three
    adapters (Express, Fastify, NestJS) and core's own listener use the
    same `applyDashboardSecurityHeaders()` helper for consistency.
  - **Auth errors funnel through `onError`.** A new `MountOptions.onError`
    hook receives unexpected internal errors (e.g. a custom `verify`
    function that threw) so they surface in observability rather than
    becoming unhandled rejections. The HTTP response is `500 Internal
Server Error`.

  **Performance & reliability**

  - **Perf bench.** `pnpm bench` (in the new private `@node-xray/bench`
    package) runs 5000 requests + 500 warmup against an Express server
    with and without `@node-xray/express`. Reports rps, mean, p50/p95/p99
    latency, and overhead.
  - **Soak test.** `packages/express/src/soak.test.ts` fires 5 batches of
    200 requests across 5 different routes (GET, POST, slow, error, 404)
    and asserts that the ring buffer stays bounded at 50 entries and
    heap growth is under 25 MB. The test passes on Node 20/22/24.

  **Documentation**

  - `docs/SECURITY.md` now includes the full redaction table, the full
    CSP table with all directives and what each one blocks, and a
    dedicated "HTTP dashboard endpoint also requires auth" section.

  **Test count:** 161 (was 150). Breakdown: types 11, core 90, dashboard
  9, express 20, fastify 17, nestjs 14.

  **Coverage:** core 81.2%/82%, express 88.4%/70.5%, fastify 82.1%/76%,
  nestjs 83.4%/62.6%, types & dashboard/src 100%.

### Patch Changes

- 75306bb: Fix CI coverage job: add `@vitest/coverage-v8` as a per-package dev
  dependency and add a `test:coverage` script that runs vitest with
  `--coverage --passWithNoTests`. The previous `pnpm -r test -- --coverage`
  invocation failed because the v8 coverage provider is a separate
  package that was not declared anywhere.

  This is a tooling-only fix. No runtime API changes.
